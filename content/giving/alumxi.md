Note that AlumXi is a 501(c)7 not-for-profit and contributions are
**not** tax-deductible. If that is a significant concern, you can [donate to certain MIT funds](#giving-to-mit) instead.

Note this payment will **continue until you stop it**. (You can stop it from the **My preapproved payments** section on the [PayPal web site](https://www.paypal.com/), or you can write to us for help.)

## How to Make a Donation by Mail

[PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/) charges a **`$0.30 + 2.9%` transaction fee**, so it’s not a good choice for large donations. To avoid this fee, either send a check (below) or have your bank/brokerage send funds directly (contact the treasurer for details).

Checks should be made out to “Alumni Association of Xi Chapter of Tau Epsilon Phi” and mailed to:

```
ALUMNI ASSOCIATION OF XI CHAPTER OF TAU EPSILON PHI, INC.
c/o NIKO MATSAKIS
11 HENRY AVE
SOMERVILLE, MA 02144
```

AlumXi’s mailing address changed to the address above in February, 2020.

Thank very much for your support!

# Dues

Annual dues for the Alumni Association of Xi Chapter of Tau Epsilon
Phi Inc are `$5`, and can be paid by PayPal or check. Any amount above
`$5` will be considered a donation.

# Donating to Xi Chapter Directly

You can also send a check directly to the undergraduates. This is also _not_ tax deductible.

# Giving to MIT

Giving money to MIT helps maintain MIT’s educational excellence and assists the current generation of MIT students to cope with eye-popping cost of an MIT education.

There are two funds of particular interest to MIT alumni of TEP:

# The FredFund

Fred Fenning was a beloved member of TEP who died after his airplane experienced a mechanical failure. Fred donated his time generously to the house after graduating and his technical abilities and warm-hearted nature were an inspiration to generations of TEPs.

The FredFund is an endowed scholarship at MIT that was set up by Fred’s parents after his death. The current principal in the FredFund is `$513,082` (as of Dec 2013) and it has paid out `$284,501` in scholarship funds since its inception in 1998.

Help support scholarships for undergraduates by directing your MIT gift to the FredFund.

# The IRDF

The IRDF (Independent Residence Development Fund) provides a pool of money that is used to subsidize loans to Independent Living Groups. The loans are generally used for capital improvement programs.

Xi chapter has made use of IRDF funds for a number of projects, including:

- Fire alarm systems
- Kitchen ventilation
- Double-pane windows

The IRDF provides loans at below-market rates and donations from alumni help make up the difference. Help support much-needed infrastructure improvements at MIT’s ILGs by directing your MIT gift to the IRDF.
