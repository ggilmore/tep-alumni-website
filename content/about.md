TEP was founded at Columbia University in 1910 and from its founding
days has been open to college men of any race or religion. We take
pride in TEP’s egalitarian history, and we work to further that
tradition by seeking to open membership in TEP Xi Chapter to all MIT
students.

# The Creed of Tau Epsilon Phi

TO LIVE in the light of Friendship—to judge our fellows not by their
rank not wealth but by their worth as men—to hold eternally before us
the memory of those whom we have loved and lost—to hold forth in the
solidarity of our brotherhood the nobility of action which will—make
for the preservation of our highest and worthiest aim—and thus be true
to the ideal of friendship—

TO WALK in the path of Chivalry- to be honorable to all men and defend
that honor—to fulfill our given pledge at all times—to be true to the
precepts of knighthood and win the love and care of the women of our
dreams—and thus be true to the ideal of chivalry—

TO SERVE for the love of Service—to give unselfishly that which we may
have to offer—to do voluntarily that which must be done —to revere God
and to strive in His worship at all times—and thus be true to the
ideal of service—

TO PRACTICE each day friendship—chivalry—service—thus keeping true to
these—the three ideals—of the founders of our fraternity—this is the
Creed of Tau Epsilon Phi.
