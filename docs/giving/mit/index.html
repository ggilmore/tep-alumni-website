        <p>Giving money to MIT helps maintain MIT’s educational excellence and assists the current generation of MIT students to cope with eye-popping cost of an MIT education.</p>
<p>There are two funds of particular interest to MIT alumni of TEP:</p>
<h1 id="the-fredfund">The FredFund<a href="#the-fredfund" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>Fred Fenning was a beloved member of TEP who died after his airplane experienced a mechanical failure. Fred donated his time generously to the house after graduating and his technical abilities and warm-hearted nature were an inspiration to generations of TEPs.</p>
<p>The FredFund is an endowed scholarship at MIT that was set up by Fred’s parents after his death. The current principal in the FredFund is <code>$513,082</code> (as of Dec 2013) and it has paid out <code>$284,501</code> in scholarship funds since its inception in 1998.</p>
<p>Help support scholarships for undergraduates by directing your MIT gift to the FredFund.</p>
<p><a href="https://giving.mit.edu/givenow/DesSearch.dyn?searchstring=Fenning">Give to the FredFund at MIT</a></p>
<h1 id="the-irdf">The IRDF<a href="#the-irdf" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>The IRDF (Independent Residence Development Fund) provides a pool of money that is used to subsidize loans to Independent Living Groups. The loans are generally used for capital improvement programs.</p>
<p>Xi chapter has made use of IRDF funds for a number of projects, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fire alarm systems</li>
<li>Kitchen ventilation</li>
<li>Double-pane windows</li>
</ul>
<p>The IRDF provides loans at below-market rates and donations from alumni help make up the difference. Help support much-needed infrastructure improvements at MIT’s ILGs by directing your MIT gift to the IRDF.</p>
