      <description>We are announcing our first 22nd annual capital campaign. Donate 253 Commonwealth Ave is the hub of the hub of the universe. Whom among us does not recall the house and all that it meant and still means to us? Living at the house was the foundation around which our MIT experience was built, and having lived there is still a large part of our lives. As we know, college friendships last a very long time.</description>
