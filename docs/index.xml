      <description>We are announcing our first 22nd annual capital campaign. Donate 253 Commonwealth Ave is the hub of the hub of the universe. Whom among us does not recall the house and all that it meant and still means to us? Living at the house was the foundation around which our MIT experience was built, and having lived there is still a large part of our lives. As we know, college friendships last a very long time.</description>

There are two funds of particular interest to MIT alumni of TEP:
The FredFund Fred Fenning was a beloved member of TEP who died after his airplane experienced a mechanical failure. Fred donated his time generously to the house after graduating and his technical abilities and warm-hearted nature were an inspiration to generations of TEPs.</description>

      <description>TEP was founded at Columbia University in 1910 and from its founding days has been open to college men of any race or religion. We take pride in TEP‚Äôs egalitarian history, and we work to further that tradition by seeking to open membership in TEP Xi Chapter to all MIT students.
The Creed of Tau Epsilon Phi TO LIVE in the light of Friendship‚Äîto judge our fellows not by their rank not wealth but by their worth as men‚Äîto hold eternally before us the memory of those whom we have loved and lost‚Äîto hold forth in the solidarity of our brotherhood the nobility of action which will‚Äîmake for the preservation of our highest and worthiest aim‚Äîand thus be true to the ideal of friendship‚Äî</description>
